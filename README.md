# Developer's Guidline

*please read these guildlines carefully and follow them.*

1. **create your own branch from development branch** (because development branch has the most latest updates).

2. use understandable commit messages or use copilot commits.

3. please **do not commit all the changes at once**. commit every change with a commit message like what you have done.

5. update your branch with development branch periodically. --> ***git pull origin development***

4. merge your branch with development branch at the end of the day (to decrease merge conflicts and file missing confusions). --> ***git checkout development --> git pull origin my_branch_name***
